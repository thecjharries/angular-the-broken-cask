This project aims to simplify some of the generation from [The Broken Cask](http://www.shorelessskies.com/p/broken-cask.html) by [Shoreless Skies Publishing](http://www.shorelessskies.com/) using [publically available information](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1igJjxqh_k1jstrykBEHyVkMmWt_gy6bq/view?usp=sharing) (from [the downloads page](http://www.shorelessskies.com/p/blog-page.html)).

## Roadmap

* Create a table component that can display the static content on a webpage
* Add all the static content
* Add a roll component that can roll dice
* Wire the two together per table
* ???

## Boilerplate Below

This is all the Angular boilerplate; it's somewhat useful to me for now because I'm too lazy to have a browser tab with this.

# AngularTheBrokenCask

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
